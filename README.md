## Introduction
A simple Image classifier App to demonstrate the usage of Resnet50 Deep Learning Model to predict input image.
This application is developed in python Flask framework.

## What is Resnet50 ?

Resnet is short name for Residual Network that supports Residual Learning.
The 50 indicates the number of layers that it has.
So Resnet50 stands for Residual Network with 50 layers.

## Why are we using Resnet50 Model ?

Resnet50 is a pre-trained Deep learning model.
A pre-trained model is trained on a different task than the task at hand and provides a good starting point since the features learned on the old task are useful for the new task.
Deep Neural networks have a large number of unknown parameters.To find all the unknown parameters would require lots of data (in millions).
It is very difficult to get such large labelled dataset.Instead we leverage models that have already being trained on very large amounts of data for difficult task with thousands of classes.
